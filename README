Intial Ideas:
We were going to go with a text adventure game because that is really the only thing we could do in the timeframe.
It was going to be some kind of mystery scenario and then Layne proposed an idea of about an
"active shooter training module" from the department of homeland security.  



Pivots:
Steve started to implement a mystery game and then Layne added to it with a practical scenario.


Data Structures:
Struct for a human: class_human, that has certain attributes of a human, like health or stamina.
Also perhaps one for a shooter with the same kind of attributes.
We will be using pointers for moving from one state to another in the game.
Recursion for losing and then playing again in the previous state.

Hardest Aspect:
